# Real_time_bus_tracker

## Description
This is a program that works with two different api's. One to import a map and markers, and the other to import bus data.
It tracks all of the active mbta busses in boston once the main button is pushed.

## How to Run
One can get this up and running on their machine by following the documentation either here or at the mapbox website, to place the map and subsequent markers on the screen. After that the data from a chosen API of you choice can be imported and passed into a marker.

To see how this one works just go to the link of the project and press 'Show Active MBTA Bus Locations in Boston'.

## Roadmap
I would like to add a geolocation tracker so the user can know where they are more easily in relation to the active busses.
